# Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Description

Feel free to check the current weather, and five-day forecast of any city using this front-end application! This app utilizes the Open Weather Map API to provide all weather data. The inspiration behind this project was to provide practice working with server-side APIs. It also allowed us to practice with 3rd party APIs such as Bootstrap.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Get started by typing in the name of the city for whose weather data you want to load into the "Search for a City:" input field. After hitting the search button, the current weather and five-day forecast data will autopopulate. Local storage will be implemented soon, so you will be able to save recent searches underneath the "Search for a City:" input field. 

For your viewing convenience, a screenshot preview of the Weather Forecast Dashboard is attached below. Here is a link to the live application: https://halversonm.github.io/weather-forecast-dashboard/
